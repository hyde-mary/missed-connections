I was rushing to catch my train but stopped when I heard you strumming an old folk song that reminded me of my childhood. You smiled at everyone who dropped a few coins into your case, but you never looked up long enough to see me staring in admiration. I wanted to say something, maybe even request a song, but I hesitated. Instead, I stood near the column, listening, wondering about the stories behind your songs. The train arrived, and I had to leave. But as I sat by the window, watching the platform fade into the distance, I regretted not staying a little longer. If you ever see this, I just wanted to sayâ€”your music made my day, and I hope you're still out there, sharing your gift with the world.",
